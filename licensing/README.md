# US Amateur Radio Licensing

Pay the $35 to the FCC to register a FRN (FCC Registration Number).   This is a generic
account to be used as your account with the FCC upon which many other licenses and
permits may be issued to.

There are currently (2025) 3 licenses available, each one granting privileges to more
frequency to play with

  - Technician: Mostly VHF/UHF (local and line of sight communication) but satellite and other fun stuff still avail
  - General: Adds HF bands, but only about half of the band is available to use
  - Extra: Adds full use of all FCC allocated frequencies

To get licensed you must pass a test for each license level.  The tests are provided by 
volunteer organizations.  Each license level has a set of questions that change every four  years.
When you take the test it will take (mostly) random questions from the pool.  The technician and general 
tests have a pool of around 400 questions, where 35 will be presented, and 26 must be answered correctly.
The extra exam has a pool around 600 questions, where 50 will be presented, and 37 must be answered
correctly.  The question pools are publicly available for free.

Usually the testing organizations will charge $15 for a test session.  During that session you may test 
for Technician, General, and Extra, one right after the other if you would like.  Assuming you pass each
successive test.  In the case a test is failed you must pay an additional $15 for another session.  Depending
on the testing organization you might be able to test again immediately or may have to schedule for a later date.
The tests can be done on paper or electronically and may be taken in-person or online.

Once you pass an exam the test proctor will submit your information to the FCC.  The FCC will then issue you
your call sign and updated license level, usually within 15 days.  You may not request a specific call sign.
The FCC will issue you one.  However you can investigate a 'vanity' call sign.  There are strict rules for
different call sign patterns.  

# Learning Resources

As always, hamstudy.org is an excellent tool for learning the questions for each class of license.
The site can help narrow down what topics you need further study on so you can focus your efforts on 
certain portions.

Some find it difficult to work through hamstudy initially due to a lack of context around what the
questions are pertaining to.  There are many resources available to the aspiring HAM.
