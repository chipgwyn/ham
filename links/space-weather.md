# Interpreting

 - Sun spots good, solar flares bad
 - LUF < Optimum Frequency < MUF - 20%
 - MUF == Maximum Usable Frequency (between 2 points at a given time)
   - Higher is better
   - Higher than this and waves go through ionosphere
 - LUF == Lowest Usable Frequency
   - Lower than this and waves absorbed by ionosphere
