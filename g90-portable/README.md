# G90 Portable Box

I wanted the box to be expandable to accept a larger battery in the future.  I figure I might add solar charging eventually as well.  The
Harbor Freight "Tactical Utility Box" fit this need perfectly.  It was large enough to hold the battery and fuse block.  I also liked that
it had a tray in the top for extra storage of various kit.  Also there is a seperate storage compartment in the lid.

I had originally planned to just make this a "power" box and my radio, antenna, and other kit would be seperate.  After building it I found
that with a little modification I could put my G90 and mic into the bottom tray and everything fit perfectly!

## Notes

 - The G90 seems to use about 6A max during Tx and less than 1A on Rx at 13.8V.  Since I'm only planning to do voice/SSB at the moment I
went with a 40% Tx duty cycle. Using the calculator at https://4sqrp.com/Battery_Capacity/index.php I figure a 15AH battery should be plenty for the 3-4 hours of 
activation time I might shoot for
 - The fuse block used is really overkill for this, but I'm new, and wanted to be safe.
 - 14AWG wire should be plenty for this, that's rated for 15A, more than this should use at any point
 - The circuit breaker isn't necessarily needed but I like having a single point to be sure there is NO power flowing in the system
 - I had a NOCO Genius 10 to help keep a vehicle battery charged, its a bit overkill for this use but works great for charging the system.
 - The Miady battery is considered a "cheap" battery compared toa BioEnno, but works great so far
